### Advanced Temporal Modeling

Improvements to the temporal component could include:

1. **Hierarchical temporal modeling**: Capture patterns at multiple time scales (hourly, daily, weekly, seasonal)
2. **Event-conditioned forecasting**: Special handling for holidays, major events, and system outages
3. **Long-term dependency modeling**: Extend the temporal context to capture seasonal and annual patterns
4. **Transfer learning from pre-trained models**: Leverage large-scale time series models pre-trained on wider datasets
